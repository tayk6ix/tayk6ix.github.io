### What I learned

I learned A LOT during this challenge. This is the first Junior Level challenge I've done (pretty nervous about it), and I got to say, it wasn't easy.

One of the first things that I learned was how to implement scss into my work. It has proven to be very helpful and see how it can potentially help me in the future. I'm confident in saying I'll keep using it and keep learing how to use the many properties that it has.

Another thing, that is small, but honestly didn't think I'd stobble upon, was the linking of certain part of my page through a links. So helpful, I'll defenitly use them in the future as well

Example : 
```html
<a href="#num1" class="menu_items">About</a>
```

Something very challenging and confusing to me at the beginning of the project was the implementation of buttons. I learned how to set up buttons and to make actions through JS. It took me a big while to figure it out lol. 

```js
document.querySelectorAll('#btn').forEach(item => {
    item.addEventListener('click', event => {
      console.log('clicked');
      item.nextElementSibling.classList.toggle('open');
    });
  });
};
```

### Continued development

Areas where I could CERTAINTLY develop on are JS and understanding CSS properties more in depth such as margin and flex-box. So if you notice any issue or have any advice on those topics I'll certaintly appreciate it.
